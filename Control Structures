IF...ELSE
Any programming language provides if..else construct for decision making.
 
if statement:
if(Boolean_expression)
{
   // Statements will execute if the Boolean expression is true
}
Ex:
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var x = 10;

      if( x < 20 ){
         println("This is if statement");
      }
   }
}

if..else statement:
if(Boolean_expression){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression is true
}else{
   //Executes when the Boolean expression is false
}

if..else if..else statement:
if(Boolean_expression 1){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 1 is true
}else if(Boolean_expression 2){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 2 is true
}else if(Boolean_expression 3){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 3 is true
}else {
   //Executes when the none of the above condition is true.
}

Nested if..else statement: Having if or if..else statements inside another if or else if.
if(Boolean_expression 1){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 1 is true
   if(Boolean_expression 2){
      //Executes when the Boolean expression 2 is true
   }
}

LOOP TYPES:
Loop: executes statements desired number of times. performs repetitive tasks.
Scala has support for following loops: while, do..while, for
