Introduction to Scala

Scala is developed by Martin Odersky and released in 2003. It integrates features of object oriented 
and functional languages.
Scala --> means scalable language. It is compiled and runs on JVM.
Scala is pure object oriented --> which means every value is treated as object.
Scala is functional --> every function is a value. Since every value is an object, every function is an object.
Scala is statically typed --> means type of the variable is known at compile time. It doesn’t expect 
to provide redundant type information.
Static typed vs Dynamic typed: In case of static typed languages, type of the variable is known at compile time. 
For dynamic typing, type of the variable is interpreted at runtime.

Scala runs on JVM --> Scala code compiles into java byte code which is executed by jvm.
Both java and scala have a common runtime platform. 

scalac --> to compile scala code
scala --> to run the byte code

scalac and scala commands are same as javac and java
