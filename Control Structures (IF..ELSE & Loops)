IF...ELSE
Any programming language provides if..else construct for decision making.
 
if statement:
if(Boolean_expression)
{
   // Statements will execute if the Boolean expression is true
}
Ex:
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var x = 10;

      if( x < 20 ){
         println("This is if statement");
      }
   }
}

if..else statement:
if(Boolean_expression){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression is true
}else{
   //Executes when the Boolean expression is false
}

if..else if..else statement:
if(Boolean_expression 1){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 1 is true
}else if(Boolean_expression 2){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 2 is true
}else if(Boolean_expression 3){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 3 is true
}else {
   //Executes when the none of the above condition is true.
}

Nested if..else statement: Having if or if..else statements inside another if or else if.
if(Boolean_expression 1){
   //Executes when the Boolean expression 1 is true
   if(Boolean_expression 2){
      //Executes when the Boolean expression 2 is true
   }
}

LOOP TYPES:
Loop: executes statements desired number of times. performs repetitive tasks.
Scala has support for following loops: while, do..while, for

Loop control statements: They change execution from normal sequence. Scala doesn't support break or continue statements as Java does
but starting from Scala 2.8 version there is a way to break the loops.

While loop:
Syntax:
while (condition)
{ statement (s);
}
Ex:
while( a < 20 ){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
         a = a + 1;
      }
      
While loop checks the condition at the top of the loop whereas do..while loop checks the condition at the bottom of the loop.

do....while

do {
statement (s);
}while (condition);
The do..while loop executes the statements atleast once irrespective of the condition.

Ex:
 do{
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
         a = a + 1;
      }while( a < 20 )


For Loop:

for(i <- 1 to 10) {
    println("i is " + i);
}

The above for loop iterates 10 times and for each iteration assigns the val i the next number 
in the range.
i <- construct is called a generator (as it generates range of values). In each iteration i is initalized with a value.
1 to 10 is called Range type. It returns a range containing the values from 1 to 10.

to vs until

for(i <- 1 until 10) {
    println("i is " + i);
}

The above for loop iterated 9 times excluding the upper boundary 10.

Iterating Collections and Arrays:
Array or collections can be iterated using the for loop as-

var myArray : Array[String] = new Array[String](10);


for(i <- 0 until myArray.length){
    myArray(i) = "value is: " + i;
}

for(value : String <- myArray ) {
    println(value);
}

In the above for loops, the first for loop intitalizes each element in the array to the text "value is: " 
with index appended.
The third for loop interates the array using the generator <-. In each iteration, next element in the array is 
assigned to value and finally printed to the console.

Multiple Ranges in a for loop:
The for loop could also contain multiple ranges separated by semicolon (;). In this case, the loop will iterate
through all the possible computations of the given ranges.
Example:
for( a <- 1 to 3; b <- 1 to 3){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
         println( "Value of b: " + b );
      }
In the above for loop 2 ranges are specified and each contains 3 elements. So total possible computations would be 3*3=9,
a combination here I would mean the pair (a,b).
Result of the above example would be:

Value of a: 1
Value of b: 1
Value of a: 1
Value of b: 2
Value of a: 1
Value of b: 3
Value of a: 2
Value of b: 1
Value of a: 2
Value of b: 2
Value of a: 2
Value of b: 3
Value of a: 3
Value of b: 1
Value of a: 3
Value of b: 2
Value of a: 3
Value of b: 3

For Loop with Collections:
 for (var x <- List)
 {
   statement(s);
 }
here List is a collection type having list of numbers and the for loop iterates through all the elements in the loop.
Example:

val numList = List(1,2,3,4,5,6);

      // for loop execution with a collection
      for( a <- numList ){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }
      
The above example could also be written as-
val numList:List[Int]=List(1,2,3,4,5,6)

  for (i<-0 until numList.length)
  {
    println("List element at i"+i+" is.."+numList(i));
  }
  
For Loop with Filters:
The for loop allows to filter out some elements using one or more if statements.
Syntax:
for( var x <- List
      if condition1; if condition2...
   ){
   statement(s);
}

Example:
val numList = List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);

      // for loop execution with multiple filters
      for( a <- numList
           if a != 3; if a < 8 ){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }
      
Upon executing the above code, the for loop outputs the values 1,2,4,5,6,7 (satisfying the both if conditions)
to the console. The above loop is equivalent to-
      
      for( a <- numList
       {
            if (a != 3; if a < 8 ) //Filtering within the loop
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

For Loop with yield:
We can store the return values of a for loop in a variable.
Syntax:
var retVal = for{ var x <- List
     if condition1; if condition2...
}yield x

Example:
val numList = List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);

      // for loop execution with a yield
      var retVal = for{ a <- numList 
                        if a != 3; if a < 8
                      }yield a
      /* The above for loop returns the values 1,2,4,5,6,7..which satisfy the coditions specified in the loop.
       Now retVal is a list which contains the values (1,2,4,5,6,7). */

      // Now print returned values using another loop.
      for( a <- retVal){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

Nested Iteration:
It is possible to do nested looping in a single for loop.
For example assume we had and array of arrays. We could iterate them as follows-

Example:
var myArray : Array[Array[String]] = new Array[Array[String]](10);

for(i <- 0 until myArray.length){
    myArray(i) = new Array[String](10);
    
    for(j <- 0 until myArray(i).length){
      myArray(i)(j) = "value is: " + i + ", " + j;
    }
}

using netsed iteration:
for(anArray : Array[String] <- myArray;
    aString : String        <- anArray ) {

    println(aString);
}


I have almost covered various control sturctures that scala provides with scenarios. would be including more if
any new constructs are added in future versions.
