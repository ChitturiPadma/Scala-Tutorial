A class is a template for objects. Once a class is defined, we can create objects using the keyword new.

Example of a Class:
class Point(xc: Int, yc: Int) {
 
 // Class variables which are fields of the class.
   var x: Int = xc
   var y: Int = yc

// Class methods
   def move(dx: Int, dy: Int) {
      x = x + dx
      y = y + dy
      println ("Point x location : " + x);
      println ("Point y location : " + y);
   }
}

The class name works as class constructor which can take a number of parameters. If we notice the above code defines two 
constructor arguments xc and yc and these are visible in the whole body of the class.

Objects can be created as-
val pt= new Point(10,20);
or 
val pt:Point= new Point(10,20);
or
var pt= new Point(10,20);
or
var pt:Point= new Point(10,20);

Extending a Class:
Method overriding requires the override keyword and only the primary constructor can pass paramters to base constructor.

class Point(val xc: Int, val yc: Int) {
   var x: Int = xc
   var y: Int = yc
   def move(dx: Int, dy: Int) {
      x = x + dx
      y = y + dy
      println ("Point x location : " + x);
      println ("Point y location : " + y);
   }
}

class Location(override val xc: Int, override val yc: Int,
   val zc :Int) extends Point(xc, yc){
   var z: Int = zc

   def move(dx: Int, dy: Int, dz: Int) {
      x = x + dx
      y = y + dy
      z = z + dz
      println ("Point x location : " + x);
      println ("Point y location : " + y);
      println ("Point z location : " + z);
   }
}

In the above example, Location is subclass and Point is superclass. Scala allows inheritance from only one class.

Scala doesn't support static memebers. Instead, scala has singleton objects. A singleton is a class which is  created 
using the keyword object rather than class. It can have only one instance. We can't pass parameters to the primary 
constructor as we could do this for other classes.

Best example for singleton objects is how we define main method in a singleton object.

Example of Singleton object:

object test {

  def main(args:Array[String]
   {
   
    }
    
}
