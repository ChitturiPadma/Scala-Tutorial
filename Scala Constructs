SCALA VARIABLES:

Variables are memory locations reserverd to store values of that particular data type of the variable.

Declaration:

var myVar : String = "hello"

Here myVar is declared using the keyword var which means the variable is mutable (i.e it can change the value).

val myVal : String = "padma"

Here myVal is declared using the keyword val which means it cannot be changed i.e immutable.

Variable Data Type:
Unlike Java, the data type of the variable is specified after the variable name and before equal sign.
Syntax: var or val VariableName : DataType [=Initial value]

variable declaration in Java: int x=10;
variable declaration in Scala: var x :int =10;

Variable type inference:
Instead of specifying the data type of the variable, based on the initial value assigned to it,
type of the variable can be inferred.
Example:
var myVar=10;
var mesg="Hello World Scala!"
In the above declaration of the variables even though type of the variable is not specified, myVar will be int type
and mesg will be of String type.

Multiple Assignments:
val (myVar:Int, mesg:String)=Pair(40,"Hi")
              (or)
val (myVar:Int, mesg:String)=(40,"Hi")
              (or)
var (myVar:Int, mesg:String)=(40,"Hi")
              (or)
var (myVar, mesg)=(100,"Hey")        

Variable Types:
Variables in scala can exist as fields, method parameters, local variables.

Fields: These variables belong to an object. These are accessible in methods defined in the object and also outside the 
object depending on the access modifier of the fields. They can be either mutable or immutable.

Method Parameters: These variables are used to pass the values inside a method and are accessible from inside the method.
These parameters are always mutable.

Local Variables: These are declared inside a method and are accessible inside the method except that if they are returned 
from the method, they will be accessible outside the method. 
Local variables can be both mutable/immutable.

SCALA ACCESS MODIFIERS:
Members of packages, classes and objects have access modifiers as private and protected. The default 
is public. These access modifiers restrict the access to the members.

Private members:
A private member is visible only inside the class or object in which it is defined.
Ex:
class Outer {
   class Inner {
      private def f() { println("f") }
      class InnerMost {
         f() // OK
      }
   }
   (new Inner).f() // Error: f is not accessible
}
Accessing f outside Inner class and inside Outer class is not acceptable since f is a private method. 
The same in java wouldn't return an error because it lets outer class access private members of inner class.

Protected Members:
A protected member is accessible only from subclasses of the class.
Ex:
class Super
{
  protected def f() {println("F")}
}
class Sub extends Super {
 f()
 }
class Other {
(new Super).f() //Error f is not accessible
}

Accessing f in subclass Sub is acceptable since f is defined as protected in Super. As the class Other is not 
inherited from Super, access to f is denied.

Public Members: There is no explicit modifier for these members. They can be accessed from anywhere.

Scope of Protection:
We can specify qualifiers for the access modifiers. A modifier of the form private[X] or protected[X]
means that access is private or protected up to X; where X could be package or class or object.


SCALA OPERATORS:

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical: &&, ||, !
Bitwise:works on bits and performs bit by bit operation. &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=

Operator precedence: This determines grouping terms in an expression which affects how an expression is 
evaluated.
