INTRODUCTION TO SCALA

Scala is developed by Martin Odersky and released in 2003. It integrates features of object oriented 
and functional languages.
Scala --> means scalable language. It is compiled and runs on JVM.
Scala is pure object oriented --> which means every value is treated as object.
Scala is functional --> every function is a value. Since every value is an object, every function is an object.
Scala is statically typed --> means type of the variable is known at compile time. It doesn’t expect 
to provide redundant type information.
Static typed vs Dynamic typed: In case of static typed languages, type of the variable is known at compile time. 
For dynamic typing, type of the variable is interpreted at runtime.

Scala runs on JVM --> Scala code compiles into java byte code which is executed by jvm.
Both java and scala have a common runtime platform. 

scalac --> to compile scala code
scala --> to run the byte code

scalac and scala commands are same as javac and java

STEPS TO INSTALL/RUN SCALA:

On Windows:

1. Java setup is required (java 1.5 or greater is required)
2. Download scala from http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads
   In windows, if its .msi installer, run the file as admin, accept license agreement and install it in 
   some directory (as Drive:\Scala\..) or in the default location as C:\Program Files\Scala\..

3. scala -version
   The above command displays the scala version that is installed
   
On Linux:
1. As discussed above , java is the pre-requisite for installing scala.
2. Download scala jar which looks as scala-<version>-installer.jar.
3. Now execute the following command:
   java -jar scala-2.9.0.1-installer.jar
4. During the installation process, accept the license agreement, specify the path where scala has to be installed
   (eg: /usr/local/share).
5. Finally, scala -version at the command prompt displays the version of scala that is installed.


BASIC SYNTAX:
   Scala program is a collection of objects which communicate with each other via invoking  each other's methods.
   object -> has state and behavior
   class -> template/blueprint  for the object of it's type.
   Methods -> Method is basically a behavior. Within the body of the method, logic is written, data is manipulated and 
              actions are executed.
   Fields -> These are the instant variables defined in the class. These are unique for each object and 
             and determine the state of the object.
   
   First scala program in interactive mode:
   C:\>scala
   Welcome to Scala version 2.11.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0).
   Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
   Type :help for more information.
   
   scala>
   scala> println("Hello..!!!")
   Hello..!!!
   
   Simple script mode program:
 
   object HelloWorld {
   /* This is my first java program.  
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println("Hello, world!") // prints Hello World
   }
 }

Save the above code in a notepad with .scala extension. Remember that the file name should be same as the object name
i.e HelloWorld. Now compile and run the code as below:
   
   D:\ScalaPrograms> scalac HelloWorld.scala // generates HelloWorld.class file which contains byte code
   D:\ScalaPrograms> scala HelloWorld
   Hello, World!

 Note:
 •Case sensitive
 
 •Class Names: For all class names, first letter must be in upper case. 
  If class name constitutes several words, then each inner word’s first letter must be in upper case.
  Example: MyFirstScalaClass
   
 •Method Names: All the method names must start with lover case letter. If the method name constitutes several words,
  then each inner word’s first letter must be in upper case.
  Example: def myMethodName
   
 •Program File Name: The program file name should match the object name. When saving the file append the 
  extension .scala to the end of the file name. 
  Example:  if object name is HelloWorld then the file should be saved as HelloWorld.scala
   
 •def main(args:Array[String]) -  It is the mandatory part of every scala program form which processing starts.
 
SCALA IDENTIFIERS:
As in all programming languages, keywords cannot be used as identifiers. Identifiers are case sensitive. 
Four types of identifiers are supported in scala:

•Alpha numeric identifiers:  start with alphabet or underscore. 
‘$’ special character shouldn’t be part of the identifier. Ex: age, name _hello

•Operator identifiers: These identifiers consist of operators as characters. 
These operators are printable ascii characters like +,:,?,~ or #.
Example: +, ++, <?>, :>

The scala compiler internally turns the operator identifiers into legal java identifiers with embedded $ character.
For example the operator :-> would be represented internally as $colon$minus$greater

•Mixed identifiers: Consists of alphanumeric identifier, followed by an underscore and also an operator identifier.
Example: unary_+, myvar_=

•Literal idnetifiers: It is an arbitrary string enclosed in back ticks as ``
Example: `x`, `<clint>`, `yield`
