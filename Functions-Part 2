Nested Functions:
Scala supports to define functions inside a function. The functions defined inside other functions are called 
Local functions.
Example:

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println( factorial(0) )
      println( factorial(1) )
      println( factorial(2) )
      println( factorial(3) )
   }

   def factorial(i: Int): Int = {
      def fact(i: Int, accumulator: Int): Int = {
         if (i <= 1)
            accumulator
         else
            fact(i - 1, i * accumulator)
      }
      fact(i, 1)
   }
}

Result:
1
1
2
6


Partially Applied Functions:
When we invoke a function, its like applying the function to the arguments. If we send only few arguments, it is called a 
partially applied function. Using this concept, we could bind few arguments and leave the rest to be filled in later.

Example:


import java.util.Date

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val date = new Date
      log(date, "message1" )
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      log(date, "message2" )
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      log(date, "message3" )
   }

   def log(date: Date, message: String)  = {
     println(date + "----" + message)
   }
}

In the above example, log method is frequently invoked with same value for date and different values for message.
We can actually eliminate passing the date to each call by applying that argument partially to the log.
We could do this as below-

import java.util.Date

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val date = new Date
  
/* bind value to date and leave the second parameter unbound by putting underscore. 
 This is called partially applied function stored in a variable*/

      val logWithDateBound = log(date, _ : String) 
      
  // New method is invoked with only the unbound argument message
      logWithDateBound("message1" )
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      logWithDateBound("message2" )
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      logWithDateBound("message3" )
   }

   def log(date: Date, message: String)  = {
     println(date + "----" + message)
   }
}


Functions with Named Arguments:
In a normal function call, the arguments passed must match with the order in which parameters of the callee function 
are defined.

Named arguments allow to pass parameters to function in different order however arguments are preceeded by parameter name
and equals sign.

Example:
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
        printInt(b=5, a=7);
   }
   def printInt( a:Int, b:Int ) = {
      println("Value of a : " + a );
      println("Value of b : " + b );
   }
}

In the above example, the function/method printInt is invoked from main() by passing arguments as b and then a
while parameters of printInt specified as a and then b.


Recursion Functions:
Recursion means a function can call itself. Scala supports recursive functions very well.

Example:
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      for (i <- 1 to 10)
         println( "Factorial of " + i + ": = " + factorial(i) )
   }
   
   def factorial(n: BigInt): BigInt = {  
      if (n <= 1)
         1  
      else    
      n * factorial(n - 1)
   }
}


Higher Order functions:
These are the functions that take other functions as parameters or whose result is a function.


Anonymous functions:
These are called function literals and at run time, these are instantiated into objects called function values.
First class functions -> we can express functions in function literal syntax (i.e (x:Int) => x+1
Example:
var inc = (x:Int) => x+1
var x = inc(7)-1

Multiple parameters : var mul = (x:Int, y:Int) => x*y
No parameters : var userDir = () => { System.getProperty("user.dir") }


Currying Functions:
Currying means transforming a function that takes multiple parameters into chain of functions, 
each taking a single parameter.
Syntax:
def strcat(s1: String)(s2: String) = s1 + s2

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val str1:String = "Hello, "
      val str2:String = "Scala!"
      println( "str1 + str2 = " +  strcat(str1)(str2) )
   }

   def strcat(s1: String)(s2: String) = {
      s1 + s2
   }
}



SCALA CLOSURES:
A closure is a function whose return value depends on the value of one or more variables declared outside the 
function.

Consider this example:
val multiplier = (i:Int) => i * 10

The above anonymous functions has the variable i whose value determines the return value from function.

Consider another piece of code:
val multiplier = (i:Int) => i * factor

Here there are two variables i and factor. i is the formal parameter which is the value passed to the function whenever
multiplier is called. However factor is not formal parameter.

var factor = 3
val multiplier = (i:Int) => i * factor

In the above two lines of code, factor refers to variable outside the function but which is in the scope.

Sample Code:
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println( "muliplier(1) value = " +  multiplier(1) )
      println( "muliplier(2) value = " +  multiplier(2) )
   }
   var factor = 3
   val multiplier = (i:Int) => i * factor
}

Result:
muliplier(1) value = 3
muliplier(2) value = 6
