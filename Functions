Function is a group of statements that performs a task. We can divide the code into separate functions 
such that each function performs a specific task.
There is minor difference between scala methods and functions.

A method is the one which is part of a class and has name and signature where as scala function is an object that
could be assigned to a variable.

In simple words to say, function defined as member of some object is called a method.

Scala also has support for nested functions.

Syntax of scala Function definition:
def functionName ([list of parameters]) : [return type] = {
   function body
   return [expr]
}

Here return type could be any valid scala data type. list of parameters would be list of variables separated by comma.
return type and scala data type are optional.

Example of a function with return type:

object Sum {
def Sum(a:Int, b:Int) : Int = {
 var sum:Int =0;
 sum=a+b;
 return sum }
 }
Function which returns nothing can return Unit that is equivalent to void in Java.
Funtions that donot return anything are called Procedures.

Example of a function that returns nothing:
object Hello{
   def printMe( ) : Unit = {
      println("Hello, Scala!")
   }
}


Functions call-by-name:
Typically, the parameters of the function would be by-value parameters which means the value of the parameter is 
determined before it is passed to the function.

Suppose if we would need a function that accepts an expression as a parameter which will not be evaluated until it 
is called within our function. To support this feature, scala offers call-by-name parameters.

Example:
object CallByName
{
  def main(args:Array[String])
   {
    delayed(calc());

   }
     def calc() :Int={
	
         println("In calc function...");
         return 9
	 }
   def delayed(t: => Int)
   {
    println("In delayed method..");
    print ("Parameter value is.."+t)
   }
}

Output:
In delayed method..
In calc function...
Parameter value is..9


In the above example calc() is the parameter to delayed() function. 
Once the delayed is invoked, the message :Indelayed method" is printed indicating that delayed() has been entered.
Now, while executing second print statement in delayed() (the execution takes place from right to left), the 
parameter 't'indicates the value being returned from calc. Hence calc() is entered and displays the message 
"In calc function...". The returned value 9 is printed as 
"Parameter value is...9

Funtion with variable number of arguments:
The last parameter to a funtion may be repeated. We can variable length arguments list to the function.
Example:
def printArgs(a:Int, args:String*)
{
  a=10;
  println("Value of a is...."+a);
  for(arg<-args)
  {
    println(arg);
  }
}

printArgs(10,"hello","hi')

Result:
Value of a is....10
hello
hi

a is intialized to 10 and all the remaining arguments are considered as args.
Here args declared as String* is actually an Array[String]. Also, note that the variable args is specified in the last.
Ordinary arguments specified after varargs would lead to an error.
Example:
def VarArgs_NormPars(args:String*,a:Int)
     | {
     |   println("Integer is.."+a);
     |   for(arg<-args)
     |   {
     |     println("Arg value is..."+arg);
     |   }
     | }

Result:
<console>:7: error: *-parameter must come last
       def VarArgs_NormPars(args:String*,a:Int)


Scala lets us specify default values for the function parameters. The arguments for such parameters can be omitted in which case,
default value would be taken.
Example:
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
        println( "Returned Value : " + addInt() );
   }
   def addInt( a:Int=5, b:Int=7 ) : Int = {
      var sum:Int = 0
      sum = a + b

      return sum
   }
}
